# Small Tools

A collection of small tools by Brian Sigafoos.

## CLI Tools

- [fast-format-x](https://ffx.bfoos.net) (`ffx`) - One Command. Every Formatter. The only formatter your AI needs to know.
- [gather-files](https://gf.bfoos.net) (`gf`) - Codebase → Clipboard → AI. The smartest "pro" AI models are web-UI only. Gather your codebase and paste it in.
- [git-new-branch](https://gnb.bfoos.net) (`gnb`) - Stop Naming Branches. Your brain shouldn't waste cycles on branch names. Type `gnb` and get `username/YYMMDD` — done.

## Web Tools

- [PPP Pricing Calculator](https://ppp-pricing.bfoos.net) - Make global pricing feel local. PPP keeps prices aligned with what customers can pay.
